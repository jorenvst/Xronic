features: (per track?)
    - speed per distance
    - delta between same distances in the same training
    - progression of times on a certain distance in a certain period of time
    - based on flying lap, calculate expected speed when fit over a 20 lap distance (0.9 * speed) (Pascal Theory)
    -> (if 4000fl exists AND 200fl is within a certain period of time AND both 4000fl and 200fl are within a certain period of time compared to today) check if you're fit
    - Pascal ?
